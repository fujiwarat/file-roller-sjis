This is a script to show the Shift-JIS encoded filenames and file contents
archived in a ZIP file whose filename is UTF-8 using firefox in RHEL6.


Environment
============
Environemnt RHEL 6
Create ja_JP.SJIS locale
Install P7ZIP from EPEL 6
Apply a Shift-JIS patch to file-roller
Rf: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177950

Installation
============
1. Install file-roller-sjis in /usr/bin with 755 permission
2. Assume /usr/bin/file-roller
3. Launch Firefox and click a link which indicates the ZIP file
4. Firefox shows an open dialog and change firefox to file-roller-sjis,
   check "Do this automatically for files like this from now on.",
   and click OK.

Then file-roller-sjis will runs:
export -n G_BROKEN_FILENAMES=
export -n G_FILE_ENCODING=
env LANG=ja_JP.SJIS firefox foo.zip

The saved profile will be $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE/mimeTypes.rdf
If you copy your mimeTypes.rdf to other profile directories, 
you can apply the same behavior to other people.
But probably $PROFILE will be decided after firefox is launched.

This way can work for other archive types besides ZIP.
