This is a wrapper script using file-roller to show the Shift-JIS encoded
filenames and file contents archived in a ZIP file whose filename
is UTF-8.
The motivation is to show the Shift-JIS encoding correctly when users
try to open ZIP files on web pages without manual operations.


Environment
============
Environemnt RHEL 6
file-roller
firefox
latest unzip in RHEL 6 which supports 'unzip -O' option
Rf: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177950

Installation
============
1. Install file-roller-sjis in /usr/bin with 755 permission
2. Assume /usr/bin/file-roller
3. Install gnome-file-roller-sjis.desktop /usr/share/applications
4. Modify default application for ZIP file in
   /usr/share/applications/defaults.list below [1]:

# diff /usr/share/applications/defaults.list.orig \
  /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
21c21
< application/zip=gnome-file-roller.desktop
---
> application/zip=gnome-file-roller-sjis.desktop

5. Launch Firefox and click a link which indicates the ZIP file
6. Ensure "Archive Manager for Shift-JIS ZIP" is seleced
   and click OK.

Then file-roller-sjis will check the filename encoding and if all is UTF-8,
just call file-roller and if not:

unzip -o sjis foo.zip
zip temp.zip
file-roller temp.zip


[1] When you modify /usr/share/applications/defaults.list, your desktop
will use file-roller-sjis by the system default but of course users can
customize it with the firefox preference dialog.
If you'd like to select file-roller-sjis or file-roller by users without
changing the default, you don't have to update the defaults.list but
users can select them with the firefox preference dialog.
